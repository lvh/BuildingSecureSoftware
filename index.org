* Introduction
** Who am I?
** In this talk
** Not in this talk

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * Most common security bugs
   * Importance of software updates
   * What software to use
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
     * Except barbican. Use barbican.
     * And maybe one day icecap.

* The problem

* How did we get here?
** Many companies don't care

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * New features > fixing security bugs
   * Ranks even lower than tech debt
   * At least devs know about tech debt...

** Time bombs

   Maybe they'll never go off! Right?!

** Sometimes they do

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * Billions of USD yearly
   * Companies usually not liable
   * Executives not held accountable

** Education
** Abstinence-only
** What /do/ we teach?
** Liskov substitution

   (∀ x: T(x) → p(x))

   → (∀ S: (T ⊃ S) → (∀ y: S(y) → p(y)))

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Taught in every intro to (OO) programming
   #+END_NOTES

** Least authority

   Don't give stuff more power than it needs

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Generally not taught except in specialized majors
   Majors not available at most universities
   #+END_NOTES

** /(extensive handwaving)/

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Don't mean to bash LSP, certainly not Barbara Liskov
   Does wonderful work in CS, particularly distributed systems
   Beyond question one of the great minds of CS

   Very formal LSP description, very informal POLA description

   Ignores that universities are supposed to be about research, not minting programmers
   #+END_NOTES

** If we taught POLA instead of LSP, we'd be significantly better off.

** Security is not a priority

   (Not in business, not in education)

** ⊢

** Don't be a jerk to your coworkers over infosec problems
** Don't be a jerk to your coworkers
** Don't be a jerk
** Don't

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Just... don't.
   #+END_NOTES

* Useful conversations about security
* Questions?

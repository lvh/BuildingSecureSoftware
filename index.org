   #+BEGIN_NOTES

** Not in this talk

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * Common security bugs
   * Importance of software updates
   * What software to use
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
     * Except barbican. Use barbican.
     * And maybe one day icecap.

* The problem
** All software has bugs
** Some are security bugs
** Security bugs are bad

* Bad news

** It's all bad, folks

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  * Tools don't work
  * Corps don't care
  * ~.edu~ doesn't educate

** Our tools don't work

   How do I write the unit test for "security"?

*** How do we learn software?

*** We read the docs!

*** Infosec docs?

    * Missing
    * Terrible

*** How else do we learn?

    (Especially when there's no docs)

*** We play with it!

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    1. Install software
    2. Play with it
    3. Learn something
    4. Repeat

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    If I don't know any Twisted/Django/whatever
    #+END_NOTES

*** Security doesn't work that way

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    1. Install AES
    2. Play with it
    3. Get it wrong
    4. ???

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Million ways to screw it up: all-zero IVs, unauth enc...
    Crypto generally doesn't complain when you get it wrong
    #+END_NOTES

*** It /almost/ works that way

    1. Install software
    2. Try to break it
    3. Learn something
    4. Go to 2

*** We're not trained to think that way

    * Make it work, not make it fail!
    * Often (not always) pretty hard
    * Issues usually not obvious

** Corps don't care

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * (Assuming they know; they usually don't)
   * New features > fixing security bugs
   * Ranks even lower than tech debt
   * At least devs know about tech debt...

** Time bombs

   Maybe they'll never go off! Right?!

** Sometimes they do

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * Billions of USD yearly
   * Companies usually not liable
   * Executives not accountable

** Abstinence-only education
*** What /do/ we teach?
*** Liskov substitution

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   (∀ x: T(x) → p(x))

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   → (∀ S: (T ⊃ S) → (∀ y: S(y) → p(y)))

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Taught in every intro to (OO) programming
   #+END_NOTES

*** What /don't/ we teach?
*** Least authority

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   Don't give stuff more power than it needs.

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Generally not taught except in specialized majors
   Majors not available at most universities
   #+END_NOTES

*** /(extensive handwaving)/

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Don't mean to bash LSP, certainly not Barbara Liskov
   Does wonderful work in CS, particularly distributed systems
   Beyond question one of the great minds of CS

   Very formal LSP description, very informal POLA description

   Ignores that universities are supposed to be about research, not minting programmers
   #+END_NOTES

*** POLA > LSP

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   If we taught POLA instead of LSP, we'd be way better off
   Plenty of programmers don't know about LSP, write software that violates it, but works fine
   IF you don't know about POLA it's basically always a security problem
   #+END_NOTES

** Security is not a priority

   (Not in business, not in education)

*** ⊢
*** Don't be a jerk to your coworkers over infosec problems
*** Don't be a jerk to your coworkers
*** Don't be a jerk
*** Don't

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    Just... don't.
    #+END_NOTES

* Good news

** Problems are not set in stone

   * Education is fixable
     * Teach people new tricks
     * Maybe even fix ~.edu~

** Some tools do work

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   (accidentally)

*** Channeling Glyph

    programming /n/: local understanding

*** Applied to systems

    small composed pieces > large monoliths

*** No implications

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    * microservices ↛ security bliss
    * monolithic services ↛ security issues

*** Few certainties

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    * death
    * taxes
    * software → problems

** Why can we do better?

   * Many of /our/ employers do care
     * I know mine certainly does
   * School of hard open source knocks

* Useful conversations about security

** Some vocabulary

*** Attack model

    How will they attack the system?

*** Attack surface

    How can they attack the system?

** Channeling Zooko

   Security is...

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * not perfect vs imperfect
   * not better vs worse
   * /this/ surface vs /that/ surface

** Useful security proposals

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   1. Description
   1. Attack model (+ motivation)
   1. Difference in attack surface
   1. Difference in user experience

** Attack models

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * What are you protecting against?
   * How is this addressed now?

** User experience

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * One of the most important aspects
   * Usually completely forgotten about
   * I'm looking at you, PGP

* Questions?
